  <h1>Observations and Proposal</h1>

  <h3>Observations</h3>
  <p>We observed several students in the university library and study rooms while they worked on assignments. Students
    tend to forget or misuse breaks. Students sat for long hours without taking breaks, leading to eye strain and
    fatigue. Conversely, other students got distracted and took too many breaks, losing track of time.</p>
  <p>Students also tend to switch tabs frequently. Many students have many tabs open which can be distracting because
    useless tabs are easily accessible with a simple click. They would open tabs for messaging apps, social media, or
    unrelated news when they got distracted. Some students pick up their devices or open a social media tab to look at
    recent notifications, and end up spending several minutes looking at their feed or other applications. Opening one
    unnecessary tab often leads to further distractions, and the lost time quickly accumulates. As they get more and
    more distracted by stuff in the computer or on other devices, students get less and less motivated to go back to
    their tasks.</p>
  <p>We also noticed that many students are not aware of distractions. Several users didn’t realize how much time they
    spent on irrelevant tabs. They would fall into a spiral of unproductive browsing, and there is nothing reminding
    them of their work. Most relied only on self-control, which was often ineffective, leading to procrastination.</p>

  <h3>Identifying the Problem</h3>
  <p>The problem is that students or office workers that need to focus on tasks on their computer often get distracted
    by everything else the computer can offer, such as searching the web. Most students tend to leave a lot of tabs
    open, which can be distracting, as shown in Figure 1. It makes it easier to go on a new tab and lose track of time.
    There is no subtle cue that the user can get when they lose focus of their task reminding them that they are not
    focusing on their tasks. Furthermore, some students are able to focus on their studies but tend to be focused for
    too long, which can lead to early fatigue. They also don’t get subtle cues reminding them to take healthy breaks.

  <p>Our solution would provide immediate, non-intrusive feedback when users switch to a non-focus tab, such as dimmed
    screen and subtle message. We will also add physical cues, such as LED lights and vibrations on the desk pad, that
    remind users about focus or breaks, which is more noticeable but less disturbing than on-screen popups. The Pomodoro
    technique developed by Francesco Cirillo suggests that work should be broken into 25 intervals, separated by 5
    minute breaks. After 4 intervals, a longer break of 15 to 30 minutes can be taken. Our extension will let the user
    choose their desired study intervals between 25 to 50 minutes, and their desired long break between 15 to 30
    minutes. We would make break reminders fun and rewarding, such as a coffee mug icon filling up on the top right
    corner of their screen. This would keep the cues calm and noticeable in their peripheral, without distracting them
    too much.</p>

  <h3>Developing Personas</h3>
  <p>Our observations revealed three behavioral patterns that are relevant to the usability of our application.</p>
  <p>The first pattern observed was digital distraction. We noted that students frequently switched tabs to
    non-work-related sites like social media and messaging platforms, often falling into a spiral of unproductive
    browsing. Many were unaware of how much time they lost and relied on self-control. This pattern led to the creation
    of Alex, the easily distracted student, who struggles with self-regulation and needs subtle feedback to break the
    cycle of distraction.</p>
  <p>A second pattern was the tendency to overwork without breaks. We observed students sitting for long, uninterrupted
    hours, which led to visible fatigue and eye strain. These users were so focused on their tasks that they forgot to
    take needed pauses, which can harm their productivity and well-being. This pattern is shown in the persona we
    created, Sam, the overworker. Sam is someone who requires gentle nudges to step away from the screen at healthy
    intervals to prevent burnout.</p>
  <p>Finally, we identified a pattern centered on the need for structure and visual motivation. Some students attempted
    to create schedules but found them difficult to follow without tangible reinforcement. They expressed an
    appreciation for tools that could gamify progress or provide a clear sense of accomplishment. This led to the
    persona of Mark, the balanced planner, who wants a rewarding system to help him stick to a structured work-break
    cycle and stay motivated.</p>

  <h4>1. Alex, the Easily Distracted Student</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Studies with 15+ open tabs.</li>
    <li>Intends to research but constantly ends up scrolling Instagram or YouTube.</li>
    <li>Struggles with self-control and time management.</li>
    <li>Needs subtle but effective reminders to stay focused.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>2. Sam, the Overworker</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Works long hours without breaks.</li>
    <li>Suffers from headaches and eye strain after studying.</li>
    <li>Wants to be productive but forgets the importance of resting.</li>
    <li>Needs gentle nudges to step away at healthy intervals.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>3. Mark, the Balanced Planner</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Creates study schedules but finds it hard to stick to them.</li>
    <li>Appreciates tools that gamify or visualize progress.</li>
    <li>Needs motivation and progress tracking to feel rewarded.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Use-Case Scenario</h3>
  <p>The use-case scenario describes a situation where Alex, the easily distracted student, starts studying. Alex
    decides to use our system to ensure his study session is productive. He knows that his usual study environment,
    filled with open tabs and notifications, is a recipe for procrastination.</p>

  <h4>1. Initialization and Setup</h4>
  <p><strong>User Action:</strong> Alex sits down at his desk, places his laptop on the table pad, and opens his Chrome
    browser. He clicks the extension icon in his toolbar and is presented with a simple setup interface.</p>
  <p><strong>System Reaction:</strong> The extension opens, showing two key input fields: “Focus Tabs” and “Session
    Settings.”</p>
  <p><strong>User Action:</strong> In the “Focus Tabs” field, he adds the URLs for his course website, the online
    textbook, and his Google Docs notes. For his “Session Settings,” he opts for the standard Pomodoro structure:
    25-minute focus intervals followed by 5-minute breaks. He also inputs his desired long break duration to be 15
    minutes. Finally, he clicks “Start Focus Session.”</p>
  <p><strong>System Reaction:</strong> The system acknowledges the command. The desk pad activates, and its LED strip
    emits a calm, steady green glow, providing a physical ambient cue that focus time has begun.</p>

  <h4>2. Maintaining Focus</h4>
  <p><strong>User Action:</strong> For the first 15 minutes, Alex is engaged, switching between his textbook and his
    notes. Both tabs are fully illuminated and functional.</p>
  <p><strong>System Reaction:</strong> The desk pad remains a steady green. In the browser toolbar, a small coffee mug
    icon begins to fill up gradually, visually tracking his progress toward his first break.</p>
  <p><strong>User Action:</strong> Alex thinks of something distracting and types “youtube.com” into the address bar and
    hits enter.</p>
  <p><strong>System Reaction:</strong> The system immediately identifies YouTube as a non-focused tab. The moment the
    page loads, the entire YouTube tab is dimmed with a semi-transparent grey overlay. A subtle, non-blocking message
    appears: “Not part of focus mode, stay on track!”. The desk pad delivers a gentle vibration where his arms rest. The
    desk pad’s LED light also shifts from a steady green to a slow, pulsing red.</p>
  <p><strong>User Action:</strong> The combined feedback brings Alex back to awareness. He realizes he was about to get
    distracted. He feels a sense of accomplishment from the system catching him, rather than guilt. He immediately
    closes the YouTube tab.</p>
  <p><strong>System Reaction:</strong> As he returns to his Google Docs notes, the dimming overlay vanishes, the
    vibration stops, and the desk pad’s LED seamlessly transitions back to its green light.</p>

  <h4>3. Break Time</h4>
  <p><strong>User Action:</strong> Alex continues studying productively.</p>
  <p><strong>System Reaction:</strong> After 25 minutes, the system chimes softly. The coffee mug icon in the toolbar is
    now completely full. The desk pad’s LED glow shifts from green to a warm, inviting yellow. A small, non-intrusive
    notification appears in the corner of his screen: “Break Time! 5 minutes to recharge.”</p>
  <p><strong>User Action:</strong> This interruption is perfectly timed. He was starting to feel mental fatigue. He gets
    up, stretches, and gets a glass of water, returning to his desk just as the break ends.</p>
  <p><strong>System Reaction:</strong> After 5 minutes, the system chimes again, the desk pad LED returns to green, and
    the coffee mug icon resets, ready to fill again for the next focus interval.</p>
  <p><strong>Result:</strong> Alex stays focused while studying, and takes healthy breaks without guilt. The device
    subtly notifies him when he begins to get distracted by opening unnecessary tabs. It helps maintain his focus by
    displaying a green light, providing visual validation of his attention, and a coffee mug on the interface to notify
    him of his breaks. The interface makes sure that he focuses on the right tabs.</p>

  <h3>Finding Related Products</h3>
  <p>Different solutions have been attempted to improve focus and reduce distractions for students and remote workers
    like Calmalama, Forest App and StayFocusd. Calmalama offers Pomodoro timers, a Zen mode, and customizable alarms. It
    can be configured to include sound and visual cues but it lacks integration with the browser tab and a physical
    feedback. Forest App on the other side encourages the user to focus on their task by effectively blocking
    distractions on their phones. While it lacks integration with the browser tab when installed on the mobile device,
    the less time spent on the device the more the tree grows, which gives incentive to keep growing. The StayFocusd is
    an extension based product that allows blocking of distracting websites. It classifies websites by use and blocks
    the navigation to the non-work related ones. This makes it really rigid for the user and from further investigation,
    the categorisation is non-cusomizable, meaning if you needed to watch an educational Youtube video, such as Perusall
    readings, it would classify this as entertainment, hence blocking it.</p>

  <h3>Comparing the Products</h3>
  <p>The presented related products mostly rely on self control and blocking mechanisms to work. They offer real time
    feedback when the users switch tabs. They aren’t using visual cues and basically require breaks to manage their
    rigid structure. They also don’t implement physical feedback. Our proposed system aims to be an all in one product
    that benefits from unused peripheral vision of the persona. By reducing the screen clutter and having visual and
    physical feedback coming from the peripheral environment, the system would increase focus while not disturbing the
    function of the user. With break reminders through haptic feedback and visual cues it would be fun and customizable.
    The idea of the Forest App is interesting but it limits the usage of one’s mobile device. With the same idea the
    desk mat/pad with LED lights would be like a growing tree but not obstructing functions of the user. The combined
    features of tab monitoring, physical feedback, break reminders, subtle visual icons, motivation reinforcement and
    foremost adaptability would help the user define focus for itself. It is also very useful in stressful situations.
    We can compare our proposed system to the fidget spinner, squish ball, which helps reduce stress and anxiety. Though
    their main issue is that it monopolizes the use of hands, hence reducing effective time. Our proposed idea is
    non-intrusive yet effective, it would support integrated habits not just enforce productivity. It would also allow
    users to customize their focus and break cycles while integrating hardware feedback, which is rare with productivity
    tools.</p>

  <h3>Designing at a High Level</h3>
  <p><strong>Software building blocks (extension):</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Browser extension (JavaScript, WebExtensions API)</li>
    <li>Tab monitoring logic (Chrome/Edge APIs)</li>
    <li>Timer engine (Pomodoro logic in JS)</li>
    <li>UI feedback (HTML/CSS animations + SVG)</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Hardware building blocks (desk pad):</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>LED strip (Addressable RGB LED Strip)</li>
    <li>Vibration motor (FIT0774)</li>
    <li>Microcontroller (Arduino Nano)</li>
    <li>12V Battery/USB Micro-B</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Justifying Feasibility</h3>
  <p>Our proposed system is both technically possible and well-defined for completion within a single academic semester.
    It includes a combination of browser-based software and simple hardware feedback mechanisms, all of which are
    supported by existing technologies and well-documented development frameworks.</p>
  <p>On the software side, the browser extension will be developed using JavaScript and the WebExtensions API, allowing
    for tab monitoring and user interface overlays in popular browsers like Edge and Chrome. The implementation of the
    Pomodoro timer logic will use standard JavaScript timers, and visual feedback elements like the coffee mug icon will
    be created using lightweight HTML/CSS animations (SVGs).</p>
  <p>For hardware integration, our plan is to use a microcontroller such as an Arduino to control LED lights and
    vibration motors in a desk pad. These components are affordable, easily accessible, and have extensive online
    documentation and libraries. Communication between the browser extension and the hardware will be through USB or
    Bluetooth, with Python or C++ scripts handling signal interpretation and physical feedback triggering.</p>
  <p>Our team has the necessary skills in web development, embedded systems, and user interface design to successfully
    complete this project. With past experience in browser extensions, microcontroller programming with Arduino, and
    basic circuit design, we are confident in our abilities. The estimated workload is around 20–30 hours per team
    member, factoring in time for prototyping, testing, and integration. This estimate is realistic due to the modular
    nature of the system and the availability of reusable code and hardware libraries.</p>

  <h3>Ethics Table for HCI</h3>
  <p><strong>Group/student names:</strong> Mahirul Islam, William Gagnon-Desharnais</p>
  <p><strong>Title of Project:</strong> FocusBrowse</p>
  <p><strong>Project/Study Description:</strong> The project investigates how students and office workers interact with
    their computers during study or work sessions. We will design and test a system combining a Chrome extension and a
    desk pad with LED and haptic feedback that provides subtle cues to maintain focus and remind users to take breaks.
    The study will observe how users interact with this system, focusing on its effectiveness in reducing digital
    distractions and encouraging balanced study or work cycles.</p>
  <p><strong>Number and type of participants:</strong> 8–12 participants, primarily university students and young
    professionals of ages 18 to 30. Participants will be a mix of genders and academic disciplines, with a focus on
    individuals who regularly use laptops for studying or remote work.</p>
  <p><strong>How and from where are they recruited:</strong> Participants will be recruited from the university
    community via online student groups and personal networks. Participation will be voluntary and will provide consent
    before being studied.</p>
  <p><strong>What risk could this study entail for participants?</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Mild distraction from system cues.</li>
    <li>Privacy concern related to monitoring open browser tabs.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>How can these risks be mitigated?</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Participants can pause or stop the system at any time.</li>
    <li>The system will not log personal browsing history; it only tracks whether a tab is part of the list of tabs that
      needs to be focused.</li>
    <li>Clear instructions and consent forms will outline participants’ rights and how their data will be handled.</li>
  </ul>
