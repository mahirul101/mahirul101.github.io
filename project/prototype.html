    <h2>Iterative Process</h2>

    <h3>10 + 10 Sketches</h3>
    <p>Below are the two PDF documents detailing the initial and improved iterations:</p>

    <h4>Original 10 Concepts</h4>

    <h4>Improved 10 Iterations</h4>
    <iframe src="../images/10PlusDesignSketches.pdf" width="100%" height="600px" style="border:none;"></iframe>
    </p>

    <p>
      The development of the study support system employed an iterative design process rooted in the 10+10 method. There
      were ten original ideas developed in the initial stage to explore a wide variety of possibilities for enhancing
      concentration and interest during study sessions. They varied in their complexity, from ambient lighting cues to
      touch feedback systems and interface overlays. Following evaluation of their feasibility and likely impact, ten
      improved iterations were constructed based on the previous system’s bests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two designs were selected from this improved set, each to perform a different function within the overall
      evaluation of the system. The first design was chosen specifically to test the efficacy of ambient lighting when
      incorporated into a real study environment. This version was minimalist in its interaction design to enable
      researchers to isolate and observe how lighting by itself impacted the user's focus and mood with no interference
      from other stimuli. The interest was whether minor visual cues would enhance attention in a naturalistic setting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second prototype was tested with the cumulative effect of multiple feedback cues, including vibration, color
      lighting, and a structured interface. For an immersive study environment, a paper interface was placed in front of
      the computer so that participants were able to interact with the system as they would during an actual study
      session. This allowed for the testing of multiple feedback mechanisms and their influence on user behavior,
      attention, and subjective intrusiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      By having these two disparate prototypes, the research was able to obtain complementary results: one related to
      the ambient effect of illumination in an environment, and another related to the overlap of multimodal cues across
      a working surface. This two-sided idea tried to get a comparison while understanding how diverse elements
      influence
      user experience and focus. This served as the next iteration of the system through grounded, user-driven evidence.

    <h2>Prototypes</h2>

    <h3>Prototype 1 (Chosen from Design 1 of 2nd Iteration)</h3>

    <p><strong>Prototype Setup:</strong><br>
      Laptop Screen: Displays paper mockups of the browser extension interfaces.<br>
      Desk Mat: Features an LED light strip attached under the laptop. The LED intensity and frequency
      changes based on the system's state (Low pulsing when it’s break time, rapid pulsing for distraction).
    </p>

    <h3>Prototype Testing Script</h3>

    <h4>Observer Briefing</h4>
    <div class="task-block">
      <p><em>"The purpose of this session is to evaluate the usability of a focus-enhancing study system, our role as
          observers is to observe your interactions. As such notes will be taken during the testing session, as well as
          a timelapse to decipher more in depth how you will interact with the prototype. The system that you will be
          tested on can be unintuitive and as observers we cannot provide any feedback. Thus, if there are any tasks
          that cannot be completed during the testing session, this is completely normal and can be discussed after the
          testing period ends. We ask for you to think aloud when you are working through the task. There is no wrong or
          right answer, we're in fact not evaluating you, but the system. Thank you again for participating in this
          research."</em></p>
    </div>

    <h4>Pre-test Questionnaire</h4>
    <div class="task-block">
      <p><em>"Before beginning the test, I would like you to fill out a brief questionnaire to know about your normal
          study behaviors."</em></p>
    </div>

    <h4>User Introduction</h4>
    <div class="task-block">
      <p><em>"Welcome! You will be testing FocusBrowse, a system designed to help students stay focused during
          online study
          sessions. There are two prototypes you may interact with:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The first prototype focuses on ambient lighting cues under the laptop. Slow
          pulsing = break, rapid pulsing = distraction. The coffee mug icon fills up as focus time progresses.</li>
        <li>The second prototype uses multiple feedback cues: a color-changing LED desk mat, haptic alerts, and
          structured interface. Green = focus, yellow = break/distraction. Coffee mug icon fills up as focus time
          progresses.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The following instructions apply to both prototypes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Click the FocusBrowse icon in your browser toolbar to access the system menu.</li>
        <li>Configure your focus and break durations as instructed in the benchmark tasks.</li>
        <li>Start your session and follow the visual and haptic cues provided.</li>
        <li>Think aloud as you complete each task, describing your interactions and experience.</li>
        <li>Follow break notifications and resume study when prompted.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The goal is to evaluate the system, not your performance. Your honest feedback is important for improving
        FocusBrowse."</em></p>
    </div>

    <h4>Task 1: Starting the Focus Session</h4>
    <div class="task-block">
      <p><em>"Your first task is to set up a FocusBrowse session. Imagine you have 50 minutes to work on a research
          project using three websites: your university learning platform like myCourses, Google Docs for writing, and a
          digital academic library. Please configure the system for a 50-minute focus period followed by a 15-minute
          break, and start your session. Please begin when you're ready, and remember to think aloud."</em></p>
    </div>

    <h4>Task 2: Reacting to a Distraction</h4>
    <div class="task-block">
      <p><em>"Now you're in the middle of your focus session. I'd like you to open the Youtube tab, which is a
          restricted tab. Pay attention to how the system responds, and then return to your study task on Google Docs as
          you normally would. Please begin."</em></p>
    </div>

    <h4>Task 3: Interacting with the Restrictive UI</h4>
    <div class="task-block">
      <p><em>"For your final task, imagine you now need to study on your computer by interacting with Google Docs.
          Please use Google docs as you would normally."</em></p>
    </div>

    <h4>Task 4: Taking a Break</h4>
    <div class="task-block">
      <p><em>"For this task, please continue studying using your focused websites. Work until the system tells you to
          take a break. When the break starts, please step away from the computer briefly. Return when the break is over
          and resume studying for a moment. Please begin when ready."</em></p>

    <h3>Common Errors and Points of Confusion</h3>
    <p>
      Some common errors and points of confusion were discovered through the questionnaire data. Certain participants
      rated themselves extremely low on sustaining attention even after using tools like music or white noise,
      suggesting
      that these tools may not work for everyone or were used inappropriately. There was also confusion around how to
      categorize a focus tool. Participants sometimes mixed up break reminders with distraction cues, which may have
      led to unstable feedback. The physical and visual cues of the system were occasionally perceived as intrusive
      rather
      than helpful, and the similarity between prototype features, such as glow effect versus breathing effect, may have
      contributed to vague or generic responses.
    </p>

    <h3>User Feedback</h3>
    <p>
      User feedback was mixed. Subtle effects like the glow effect and breathing effect were generally well-received, as
      were ambient lighting and the coffee mug animation. However, some participants requested a less obtrusive user
      interface and more variety in feedback. The vibration cue was particularly highlighted as annoying or unnecessary.
      One user suggested clearer differentiation between cues signaling breaks versus those signaling distractions.
    </p>

    <h3>Suggested Improvements</h3>
    <p>
      Several possible improvements can be derived from this feedback:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Explain what a focus tool is through onboarding instructions or examples.</li>
      <li>Allow users to customize feedback cues to their preferences and sensitivities.</li>
      <li>Differentiating break reminders from distraction notices using different visual styles, colors, animations, or
        durations.</li>
      <li>Reduce interface obtrusiveness to improve user experience.</li>
      <li>Enable control over feedback intensity, vibration strength, or brightness to allow more flexibility.</li>
      <li>Provide a brief tutorial or walkthrough explaining the system operation and how to interpret its signals.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These suggestions align with the research focus on improving learnability and user experience relative to the
      usability goals of the system.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Takeaways & Learning Outcome</h3>
    <p>
      The participants' perspective of the system was critical. Most of them are from an Engineering background. Study
      patterns and concentrations varied between participants, with a number relying on environmental aids like music or
      white noise but nevertheless struggling to focus. This suggests that external aids are common but may not be
      sufficient without structured support. The system prototypes featured many visual as well as physical feedback
      cues, which met mixed reactions. The absence of differentiation between break reminders and distraction alerts
      also emerged as a persistent source of confusion. The improvements needed are for customization, clearer
      differentiation of cues, and a less cluttered interface.
