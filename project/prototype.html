    <h2>Usability Goals</h2>
    <p>The success of the FocusBrowse system is evaluated against five key usability goals: Learnability, Efficiency,
      Satisfaction, Error Recovery, and Engagement (Non-Intrusiveness). The following objectives and corresponding
      metrics are designed to be directly measured using data collected from the benchmark tasks and post-testing
      questionnaire.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Learnability:</strong> The primary learnability goal is that new users can independently configure and
        initiate a focus session within 2 minutes. This will be measured by timing how long it takes participants to
        complete the "Starting the Focus Session" benchmark task, from the moment they are instructed to begin until the
        session is active and the LED light turns green. Success is defined as 100% if users complete this setup task
        within the two-minute threshold without requiring assistance from the observer.</li>
      <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> The system aims to help users maintain focus with minimal internal distraction.
        To measure this, we will analyze the time it takes for a user to complete the "Reacting to a Distraction"
        benchmark task. We will record the duration between when a user opens a non-focus tab (triggering the system's
        feedback) and when they return to a focused tab. A shorter duration indicates more efficient error recovery and
        less time has been lost to distractions. This metric will be enforced by the post-test question, "Did the system
        help you stay focused?" where a high average likert score will confirm that the system is effective.</li>
      <li><strong>Satisfaction:</strong> A core goal is for users to feel that the system genuinely supports their focus
        and productivity, leading to a positive subjective experience. This will be measured through the post-testing
        questionnaire. We will calculate the average scores from questions about ease of use, helpfulness of feedback,
        and usefulness of break reminders. Furthermore, the response to "Would you use this system on a daily study
        routine?" will serve as an indicator of the overall satisfaction of the system. These open-ended questions about
        what users liked will provide qualitative support.</li>
      <li><strong>Error Recovery:</strong> This goal focuses on the system's ability to help users quickly return to
        their task after becoming distracted. The key metric is the duration of distraction, which is the time elapsed
        during the "Reacting to a Distraction" benchmark task. We will use the timelapse recording to precisely measure
        how many seconds pass from the moment the restrictive UI is triggered , for example a dimmed screen and an
        alert, until the user has closed the distracting tab or switched back to a focused one. A successful system will
        guide users to correct their behavior, resulting in a low average distraction duration.</li>
      <li><strong>Engagement:</strong> It is critical that users do not find the system's feedback mechanisms intrusive
        or annoying. The primary metric for this goal is the direct response to the post-test question, "How much did
        you find this system intrusive?" on a Likert scale. A low average score here will indicate that the visual and
        physical cues (dimming, LED changes, vibration) were noticeable without being disruptive. This data will be
        enforced by qualitative feedback from the "What would you improve?" question, where we will note if any users
        specifically mention the feedback as being too aggressive.</li>
    </ol>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Benchmarking Tasks</h2>
    <p>To assess whether the system's usability goals are met, participants will be asked to complete a series of
      benchmark tasks. These tasks are designed to encompass the core functionality of the system, from initial setup to
      managing distractions and breaks.
    </p>
    <h4>Task 1: Starting the Focus Session</h4>
    <p>The first benchmark task requires participants to configure and initiate
      a focus session. They will be asked to set up the system for a 50-minute study period focused on specific academic
      websites, followed by a 15-minute break. The break is configurable by the user to be 15 to 30 minutes, according
      to
      the Pomodoro technique. The goal is to observe the initial setup process, measuring the time taken and noting any
      points of confusion. Success is achieved when the session timer begins, the empty coffee mug icon becomes visible
      in
      the browser interface, and the LED light is green, indicating the system is active.</p>
    <h4>Task 2: Reacting to a Distraction</h4>
    <p>This task evaluates how users respond to the system's feedback when they become distracted. During their focus
      session, participants will be instructed to intentionally open a non-focused website, such as a social media or
      news platform. The objective is to measure how quickly the combination of visual dimming, physical vibration, and
      LED color change guides them back to their main task. The key metric is the time elapsed between opening the
      distracting tab and returning to a focused study tab.</p>
    <h4>Task 3: Taking a Break</h4>
    <p>The third task assesses the system's break reminder functionality. Participants will work until the system
      automatically signals the end of the focus period. The goal is to observe whether the user acknowledges the break
      notification, indicated by a filled coffee mug, a change in the desk pad's LED color, and a subtle vibration, and
      actually steps away from their work. Success is measured by the user's adherence to the break prompt and their
      seamless resumption of work when the next focus session begins.</p>
    <h4>Task 4: Interacting with the Restrictive UI</h4>
    <p>The final task involves general navigation within the constrained environment. Participants will be asked to
      perform typical study activities, such as navigating in their pre-approved tabs. The goal is to ensure that core
      navigation remains fluid and unobstructed when staying within the defined parameters, validating that the system
      supports productivity without adding unnecessary friction to the legitimate workflow.</p>

    <h3>Prototype Testing Script</h3>

    <h4>Observer Briefing</h4>
    <div class="task-block">
      <p><em>"The purpose of this session is to evaluate the usability of a focus-enhancing study system, our role as
          observers is to observe your interactions. As such notes will be taken during the testing session, as well as
          a timelapse to decipher more in depth how you will interact with the prototype. The system that you will be
          tested on can be unintuitive and as observers we cannot provide any feedback. Thus, if there are any tasks
          that cannot be completed during the testing session, this is completely normal and can be discussed after the
          testing period ends. We ask for you to think aloud when you are working through the task. There is no wrong or
          right answer, we're in fact not evaluating you, but the system. Thank you again for participating in this
          research."</em></p>
    </div>

    <h4>Pre-test Questionnaire</h4>
